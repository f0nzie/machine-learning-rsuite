# Modelling time series relationships between the S&P 500 and oil prices

In this example, an OLS regression model is constructed in an attempt to forecast future S&P 500 levels based on the price of Brent crude oil.

However, since this OLS regression is incorporating time series data, potential violations such as serial correlation must be legislated for in this instance.

In particular, this analysis will take into account the following considerations when constructing the OLS regression model:

Use of the Durbin-Watson test to screen for serial correlation
Remedial measures to remove serial correlation (if present) with the Cochrane-Orcutt remedy
Stationarity and Cointegration tests
Cross-Correlation analysis between oil price trends and the S&P 500
Accuracy of predictions against the test data
